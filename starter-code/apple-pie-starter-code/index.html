      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
      quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first
      place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well!

      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <p>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
        saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and
        brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly.
        Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid
        over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
        degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until
        apples are soft.
